Imagine if there was a simple blood test to diagnose cancer. 

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University announced a major advance in creating a single liquid biopsy to detect multiple cancers. The team developed CancerSEEK, a blood test that can detect eight types of cancer responsible for the majority of deaths in the United States. The team used the blood test on 1,005 patients who had confirmed cancers of the ovary, breast, lung, stomach, pancreas, colon or rectum, stomach, and esophagus. These cancers hadn’t yet spread (in other words, they were nonmetastatic) and were at stages I, II, or III.

 According to results published in the journal Science, CancerSEEK was able to detect cancers at least 69 percent of the time, and this included ovarian, pancreatic, liver, stomach, and esophageal cancers— notoriously difficult to spot. Especially heartening was that the test detected ovarian and liver cancer correctly 98 percent of the time. These cancers aren’t often caught early, because patients may have few symptoms.
